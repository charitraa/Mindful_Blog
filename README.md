## 🛡️ Security Policy

### Supported Versions
The Blogify project actively maintains security updates for the following versions:

| Version  | Supported          |
|----------|--------------------|
| main     | ✅                 |
| v1.x.x   | ✅                 |
| < v1.0   | ❌                 |

### Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in Blogify, we encourage responsible disclosure. Please follow these steps:  
- Do not report security issues publicly via GitHub issues or other public forums.  
- Send a detailed report to your.email@example.com. Include:  
  - A description of the vulnerability.  
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.  
  - Potential impact (e.g., data exposure, unauthorized access).  
  - Any suggested fixes (optional).  

Allow the project maintainers up to 14 days to respond and assess the issue.  
We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and work with you to validate and address the vulnerability.

### Disclosure Process
Once a vulnerability is reported, maintainers will:  
- Validate the issue and assess its severity.  
- Develop and test a fix.  
- Release the fix in a new version or patch.  
- Credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested) in release notes.  

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days and less severe issues within 60 days.

### Security Best Practices
To ensure the security of your Blogify deployment:  
- Never commit sensitive information (e.g., `.env` files, API keys) to version control.  
- Use strong, unique secrets for `JWT_SECRET`, database credentials, and third-party services (e.g., Cloudinary, Firebase).  
- Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities:  
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm update
  cd ../backend
  npm update
  # or for Django
  pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
  ```  
- Enable HTTPS for production deployments.  
- Monitor logs and enable security headers (e.g., CSP, X-Frame-Options) in your web server configuration.

### Known Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is at least 32 characters long and cryptographically secure.  
- **Database**: Use environment-specific database configurations and restrict access to the database server.  
- **Image Uploads**: Validate and sanitize all user-uploaded content (e.g., via Cloudinary).  
- **API Security**: Use rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.
